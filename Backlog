Scheduled for 1st week of March:
- #12 : Reuse PVC (see below) and Primary becomes a Replica

As part of the available options for the field "failover.pvc", there would be:
    "keep": the default option currently with Kubegres where PVC are kept but not reused for safety and investigation reasons
    "delete": the PVC will be deleted
    "reuse": if the state of the PVC is healthy, it will be reused by the newly created Replica pod. I think that matches with your suggestion?
